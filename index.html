        <h1>My name is Jessica</h1> 
        <p>I'm a freshman in highschool and my favorite subject is math. My favorite food is ramen and I like to skateboard. I'm currently learning how to ollie but it's pretty tricky.</p>
        <p>I also like to crochet in my spare time. My favorite thing that I've made so far is a bag! I didn't find a pattern I liked so I ended up freehanding it.</p>
