# About Me

I'm currently a freshman in highschool. I'm enrolled in this course through the CCP program and I'm excited to be here! My favorite subjects are math and biology.

## My Hobbies

Some of my hobbies include:

1. Crochet  
I've been crocheting for about 3 years now and the first complete thing I ever made was a ghost! This is what it was supposed to look like but mine ended up a bit shorter. ![Ghost](https://www.stitchbyfay.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_20210923_113242_884-01blog-1-1024x1024.jpg)

Some of my favorite games are *Subnatica*, *Team Fortress 2*, and *Minecraft*.

1. Taekwondo  
I've been doing Taekwondo since 7th grade and I'm one belt level away from being a blackbelt.

1. Reading  
I love reading! It's hard to find a genre I won't read but I prefer fantasy or historical fiction.

## Websites I Recommend

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I use YouTube for so many things! Anytime I'm looking up a new crochet pattern or trying to learn a trick on my skateboard I always end up here. Its wealth of information is invaluable when learning new skills.  

[Ghost Pattern][ghost] - This is the pattern I used to make the first my first ghost. It introduced me to lots of new stitches and techniques I had never seen before. This was the project that got me hooked on crocheting.

[YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) - I tend to do most of my work on my computer alone but I hate working in silence. I use YouTube Music all the time to listen to my favorite songs.
